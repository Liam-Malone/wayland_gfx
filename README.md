# Liam's Graphics/Window/Input Context Lib

This is starting out as a wayland-only library, I plan to later add support for Windows through Win32, maybe X11, and will get around to Mac support eventually. Starting out in C to figure things out, though I may well switch over to Zig soon-ish.

## Building

To build, simply run the following

```shell
$ ./build.sh <options>
```

## Wayland

Wayland protocols I will use can be found [here](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/tree/stable).
